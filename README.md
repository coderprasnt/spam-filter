# üìß Email Spam Filter

## Introduction
The Email Spam Filter is a tool designed to analyze and filter out spam emails using various criteria and machine learning algorithms. This repository provides a simple yet effective implementation of a spam filter in Python.

## How It Works
The tool uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam. It is trained on a dataset of labeled emails and can be used to predict whether new emails are spam.

## Features
- Analyzes email content and metadata.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for spam classification.
- Provides a simple command-line interface for testing and usage.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coderprasnt/email-spam-filter.git
    cd email-spam-filter
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the spam filter**:
    ```bash
    python spam_filter.py
    ```

## Usage
The tool can be used to classify emails as spam or not spam. It takes a text file containing the email content as input and outputs whether the email is spam.

### Example
```bash
python spam_filter.py --email_path "path/to/email.txt"
```

## Conclusion
The Email Spam Filter is a powerful tool for detecting and filtering out spam emails. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, it provides an effective solution for managing email spam.
